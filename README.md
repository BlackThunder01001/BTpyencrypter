# BT-pyEncrypter
A simple software made in Python to encrypt and share your messages which can be decoded only with a unique code.

# Getting Started:
Download python and open the `btpyencrypter.py`. This will open a console and you are ready to encrypt.


# Safety:

Code is encrypted too to prevent spam and stealing the messages. No need to worry.
The msg you encrypt will give you a code _(if you left the code field empty otherwise your custom code)_ which will be 4-digit long. One cannot decode the msg without the code.
